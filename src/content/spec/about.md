# About
A software developer based in Hong Kong with a diverse background in education and AI research. My experience ranges from teaching assistant positions in coding bootcamp to serving as a research assistant at university, specializing in web technology, server CI/CD, cloud architecture, and deep learning for application-level solutions.   

Additionally, I have contributed to various non-profit organizations, schools, and limited companies by tutoring, editing course materials, and designing websites.     

Beyond this, I develop plugins, mobile apps, extensions, and packages aimed at aiding design and general-purpose use.
